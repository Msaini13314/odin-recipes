                This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
                made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
                A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
                ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese 
                and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
                green salad and crusty garlic bread.
