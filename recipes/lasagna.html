        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
        ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese 
        and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
        green salad and crusty garlic bread.
